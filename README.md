# Dimensionality Reduction and K-means Clustering

## Introduction

Dimensionality reduction and clustering are powerful techniques in the field of data science that are commonly used for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional datasets. In this context, we will explore the Lego colors dataset, which contains information about the color distributions of various Lego sets. This dataset contains a large number of features that describe the color and quantity of each Lego brick in a set. However, visualizing and analyzing this dataset can be challenging due to the high number of dimensions. Therefore, we will use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the number of dimensions and k-means clustering to group similar Lego sets based on their color distributions. By doing so, we can gain insights into the underlying structure of the dataset and identify patterns that may be useful for further analysis or for designing new Lego sets. In this project, we will demonstrate how to use dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques in Python to analyze the Lego colors dataset.
